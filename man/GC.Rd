\title{Measurement of connectedness.}
\usage{
GC(Kmatrix, Xmatrix, sigma2a, sigma2e, MUScenario, statistic, NumofMU)
}
\arguments{
\item{Kmatrix}{a n by n relationship matrix.}

\item{Xmatrix}{a design matrix which associates fixed effects with phenotypes.}

\item{sigma2a}{additive genetic variance.}

\item{sigma2e}{residual variance.}

\item{MUScenario}{a vector of managment units which will be treatd as a factor.}

\item{statistic}{a statistic which will be used to measure connectedness.}

\item{NumofMU}{number of management unit used to calculate connectedness.}
}
\value{
A value of overall connectedness measurements across management units when NumofMU is set as 'Overall'.
A matrix of connectedness measurments with diagnol as NA when when NumofMU is set as 'Pairwise'.
}
\description{
The estimates of connectedness across management units.
