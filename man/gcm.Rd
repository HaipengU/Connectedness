\title{Genetic connectedness analysis}
\usage{
gcm(Kmatrix, Xmatrix, sigma2a, sigma2e, MUScenario, statistic, NumofMU,
  Uidx = NULL, scale = TRUE, diag = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Kmatrix}{A relationship matrix with a dimension of n by n, where n refers to the total number of individuals.}

\item{Xmatrix}{A design matrix which associates fixed effects with phenotypes and the intercept is excluded. 
The first column of \code{Xmatrix} should start with design matrix of unit effects, following with other fixed effects if applicable.}

\item{sigma2a}{Additive genetic variance.}

\item{sigma2e}{Residual variance.}

\item{MUScenario}{A vector of units which will be treatd as a factor.}

\item{statistic}{A statistic measures genetic connectedness, which includes 
\itemize{
  \item 'PEVD_IdAve' : Individual average PEVD, the optional argument of 'scale' is available. 
  \item 'PEVD_GrpAve' : Groupd average PEVD, the optional arguments of 'scale' and 'diag' are available.
}}

\item{NumofMU}{number of management unit ('Pairwise' or 'Overall') used to calculate connectedness.}

\item{Uidx}{a interger to indicate the last column of unit effects in X matrix. This Uidx is required for statistics VED2, CDVED2 and CR2. The default is NULL.}

\item{scale}{logical argument. Should sigma2a be used to scale statistic (e.g., PEVD_IdAve, PEVD_GrpAve, PEVD_contrast, VED0, VED1 and VED2) to remove units? Default is TRUE.}

\item{diag}{logical argument. Should diagnoal elements of PEV matrix (e.g., PEVD_GrpAve, CD_GrpAve and r_GrpAve) or K matrix (CDVED0, CDVED1 and CDVED2) be included? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A value of overall connectedness measurements across units when NumofMU is set as 'Overall'.
A matrix of connectedness measurments with diagnol as NA when when NumofMU is set as 'Pairwise'.
}
\description{
Estimates genetic connectedness across units using pedigree or genomic data.
