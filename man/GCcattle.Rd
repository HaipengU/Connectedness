\description{
The cattle dataset is simulated with QMSim software (Sargolzaei and Schenkel, 2009).   
This dataset includes 530 individuals across five generations (from founder to generation 4), 
each with 10, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms spread over 29 autosomes. Single phenotype with heritability of 0.6 was simulated.
Three fixed covariates of sex, the management unit, and covariate 3 are available.
